I will be using MERN stack and will attempt to use Google Authentication if I can get it to work for creating an account

For my project I will be building a media sharing app(similar to Pinterest) where users can comment and upload media once they create an account.
Initally I will only use images for the media type but would like to evenutally add videos.
Users will be able to search the images library and find images that are categorized by subject matter.
Example: User can search "pets" and will get images related to that search.
